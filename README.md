Python automation projects for IMS/VoLTE protocol log analysis and KPI extraction
# Telecom Python Automation Projects

This repository contains Python automation projects focused on telecom protocol analysis, built to automate tasks commonly performed during IMS, VoLTE, and MCPTT testing.

## Projects

### 1. SIP Call Setup Time Analyzer
- Parses SIP logs
- Extracts INVITE and 200 OK timestamps
- Calculates VoLTE call setup time KPI

### 2. RTP Packet Loss Detector
- Parses RTP logs
- Extracts RTP sequence numbers
- Detects missing packets to identify packet loss

### 3. IMS Registration Flow Checker
- Validates IMS registration flows
- Detects REGISTER / 401 / REGISTER / 200 OK (VoLTE)
- Supports REGISTER / 200 OK (MCPTT)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (file handling, loops, string parsing)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SIP, RTP, IMS, VoLTE, MCPTT
- Protocol log analysis and KPI automation
